- 👋 Hi, I’m @Chaos0328
- 👀 I’m interested in returning to the roots of crypto and creating a minable crypto currency. I want to help create a NFT platform and exchange for music and the resale of tickets/merchandise to dethrone the Ticketmaster Monopoly and return revenue to the artist. I have multip ideas for lines of NFTs. My ideas are limited to my inability to code in any form. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Everything. I can't code...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...NFTs, crypto and exchanges
- 📫 How to reach me ... @ChaosTheoryUltd or johnmurphy042000@gmail.com
